/**
 * Registration Fix Verification
 *
 * This file documents the changes made to fix the user registration issue
 * where user data was being saved to the 'drivers' collection instead of
 * the 'users' collection.
 *
 * ISSUE:
 * - User registration was saving data to 'drivers' collection
 * - This caused inconsistency in data structure and admin management
 *
 * SOLUTION:
 * Updated all functions in authService.ts to use 'users' collection:
 *
 * 1. registerUser() - Changed setDoc to use 'users' collection
 * 2. loginUser() - Changed getDoc to read from 'users' collection
 * 3. loginUser() - Changed setDoc to update 'users' collection for email verification
 * 4. updateUserProfile() - Changed setDoc to update 'users' collection
 * 5. getUserProfile() - Changed getDoc to read from 'users' collection
 *
 * VERIFICATION:
 * After these changes, new user registrations will:
 * - Save user data to the 'users' collection in Firestore
 * - Allow proper admin management through the enhanced User Management panel
 * - Maintain consistency with existing user management services
 *
 * TESTING:
 * To verify the fix works:
 * 1. Go to /driver/register
 * 2. Register a new user
 * 3. Check Firestore console - data should appear in 'users' collection
 * 4. Verify user appears in Admin Panel > User Management
